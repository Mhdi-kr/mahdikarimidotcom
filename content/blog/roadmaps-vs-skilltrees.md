I'm trying to come up with a skill tree that is as broad as possible, but still as specific as possible.

Road maps are great for describing the order of steps taken in a project or a tutorial, but real life and _your motivation_ does not work like that.

for example in [the infamous web development road map repo](https://roadmap.sh/) there's git and source control step in the very beginning of the road map. my career did not start with git! I started web development messing around with pure HTML. not even a single line of js code was written! I did not consider myself proficient in git until my second or third job! so I think these roadmaps do not represent my real life.

In my opinion real life is much more like a tree, where you can go from a root node to any leaf node if you wanted! you can choose to learn a little bit HTML and css and decide to go and learn more about js without anyone forcing you to learn git (or any arbitrary technology) first.

tired of learning about react hooks or redux? why don't you hop onto CSS and animations to spice things up?

This is less overwhelming and more inclusive.
