I'm Mehdi, currently working as a senior software engineer at [`Alibaba Travels Co.`](https://alibaba.ir)

I spend my working hours mentoring software engineers and architecting backend and machine learning solutions.

In my off-time, I read computer sience related books, play the guitar (love the pantetonic scale and blues!) and I also write [here](/posts) sometimes.
